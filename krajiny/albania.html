                Albania, known to Albanians as Shqipëria or Land of the Eagles,
                was once Europe's most mysterious country. A Stalinist
                dictatorship from 1946 to 1991, it shut itself off from the rest
                of the world. However, the Communist regime was overturned in
                1991 and most of Albania is now safe to visit. It's easy to
                reach from western Europe by train to Italy then ferry across
                the Adriatic, or it can be reached overland by train to
                Montenegro then bus or taxi across the border into Albania. It's
                a fascinating country that will challenge your pre-conceptions
                of things Albanian.

                  Eagles, was once Europe's most mysterious country. A Stalinist
                  dictatorship from 1946 to 1991, it shut itself off from the
                  rest of the world. However, the Communist regime was
                  overturned in 1991 and most of Albania is now safe to visit.
                  It's easy to reach from western Europe by train to Italy then
                  ferry across the Adriatic, or it can be reached overland by
                  train to Montenegro then bus or taxi across the border into
                  Albania. It's a fascinating country that will challenge your
                  pre-conceptions of things Albanian.

              (pictured above right) before catching the train to Turin or

            <h3>2. Paris to Milan by TGV...</h3>
            <p>
              SNCF (French Railways) operates three daily 186 mph TGV trains
              from Paris to Milan. Previously operated by Artesia, a consortium
              of Trenitalia & SNCF, they are now operated entirely by SNCF,
              officially via a new Italian subsidiary, Società Viaggiatori
              Italia. On leaving Paris they sprint over the high-speed line at
              up to 186 mph (300 km/h) as far as Lyon St Exupéry, but they then
              slow right down to meander through the scenic Alpine foothills on
              conventional lines via Chambéry, crossing into Italy at Modane and
              heading through Turin to Milan. These TGVs have 1st & 2nd class
              seats and are fully air-conditioned, with new interiors designed
              by Christian Lacroix. There are power sockets for laptops and
              mobiles at every seat and there are baby-changing facilities and
              designated spaces for passengers in wheelchairs. There's a
              cafe-bar serving drinks, snacks & light meals, or feel free to
              bring your own food & wine along for the journey. In first class
              you can order a 3-course meal with wine, served at your seat. You
              can now buy Paris metro tickets from the bar car, too. 1st class
              TGV passengers can use the Grand Voyageurs 1st class lounge at
              Paris Gare de Lyon. Incidentally, SNCF's experienced in-house
              designer still hasn't forgiven Christian Lacroix for breaking the
              unwritten rule and using warm colours in 2nd class, cooler colours
              in 1st class, so see what you think!

              The TGV crosses the Alps via Chambéry and Modane, passing through
              the 13.6 km (8.5 mile) long Fréjus Rail Tunnel, also known less
              accurately as the Mont Cénis tunnel. The tunnel transit takes just
              7 minutes, during which the train enters Italy. Opened in 1871,
              this the oldest of the large tunnels through the Alps, and was the
              longest tunnel in the world from 1871 until 1882 when the Gotthard
              tunnel opened on the Zurich-Milan route.

                  Traveller Gwylan Williams sailed from Bari to Durres with GNV

                </span>
                <q>
                  The ferry was very good, and we had a smooth crossing. There
                  were a lot of staff available to help with luggage etc, all in
                  crisp, clean, uniforms. The bunk beds were nice and wide,
                  comfortable and clean, we both slept very well. The en suite
                  shower room was good too, with a decent shower and plenty of
                  hot water. Although the sailing was late at night, there was
                  freshly cooked food available, they seemed geared up to cater
                  for the lorry drivers. Good breakfast too. We couldn't change
                  money for Leks on board but they told us where to go once we
                  landed at Durres and we had a perfectly good exchange rate
                  there.

              <h2>London to Tirane overland</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              You can also travel overland to Albania, by train from London &
              Paris to Belgrade, then the spectacular railway from Belgrade to
              Podgorica or Bar in Montenegro, then by bus or taxi to the border
              and on to Shkodër, for the daily Albanian train to Tiranë. There
              may be security concerns in some border areas of Albania, so check
              the latest Foreign Office travel advice at
              www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice. The overland option generally
              takes a day or two longer than the more straightforward train &
              ferry option via Italy, but you can stop off and see some
              remarkable parts of the Balkans on the way, such as Belgrade and
              Montenegro. Why not go out by ferry and back overland, or vice
              versa? Here's how to travel overland:
            </p>
            <h2>From London to Tirane</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Step 1, travel from London or Paris to Belgrade as shown on the
                London to Serbia page. The journey takes 2 days and 1 night, or
                2 nights. Arrange train tickets as shown on that page. Allow at
                least 2 or 3 hours in Belgrade for onward connections (or stop
                overnight) as trains may arrive in Belgrade an hour or two late.
                <span class="cursive"
                  >Note that the Zagreb-Belgrade train is still suspended due to
                  Covid-19, Serbia cut off.</span
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 2, then take a train from Belgrade to Podgorica or Bar in
                Montenegro over the fabulous Belgrade-Bar railway. There is a
                choice of daytime train or overnight sleeper train on this
                route. The daytime train means a long journey but it's a good
                choice for the fantastic scenery along this remarkable rail
                line. However, it requires an overnight in Podgorica or Bar. The
                sleeper train is more time-effective and it puts you in
                Podgorica or Bar in the morning with time to make your way to
                Shkodër in Albania that day, and you'll still see the best
                scenery at the southern end of the line. See the Belgrade to
                Montenegro page for times, fares, photos & info. You can check
                train times at the Serbian Railways website www.srbvoz.rs. Buy
                your ticket at the station.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Step 3, you have a choice of going via Bar or Podgorica, as
                  follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="cursive">Option 1, get off at Podgorica...</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Buses link Podgorica with Shkoder & Tiranë once or twice a
                  day, try busticket4.me/EN. You get off in Shkoder and take a
                  train from Shkoder to Tiranë if you like, more fun than
                  staying on the bus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternatively, take a Montenegrin taxi from Podgorica to the
                  Albanian border at Han i Hot for around €20, cross into
                  Albania, then take an Albanian taxi from Han i Hot to Shkodër
                  for around €20 more. The total distance from Podgorica to
                  Shkodër is 59.7 km, the journey should take about 90 minutes
                  including a change of taxis at the border crossing. Stay
                  overnight in Shkodër. Next day, take a train (if running, see
                  below) to Durrës & Tiranë, see the train timetable section
                  below. Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër area.

                <p>
                  Walk 250m from Bar station to Bar's main bus station. Buses
                  run from Bar to Ulcinj every hour or two from 08:50 until
                  22:45, journey time about half an hour, fare around €2.50.
                  Then there are three buses a day from Ulcinj (Montenegro) to
                  Shkodër via the Muriqan border crossing, departing Ulcinj main
                  bus station at 06:00, 12:30 & 16:30, taking an hour, fare
                  around €6, or you can take a taxi from Ulcinj to Shkoder for
                  around €15-€20. You can then stay overnight and take the
                  morning train to Tiranë. Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër area.

                  <span class="cursive">Option 1</span> is to travel by taxi to

                  i Hot border to Podgorica in Montenegro, or travel by bus to
                  Ulcinj then another bus to Bar in Montenegro. If you choose
                  the taxi option, the total journey from Shkodër to Podgorica
                  is 59.7 km, and should take about 90 minutes including the
                  need to change taxis at the border. Each of the two taxis
                  should cost in the region of €20. Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër

                <p>
                  <span class="cursive">Option 2</span> is travel by bus to
                  Ulcinj in Montenegro then onwards by bus to Bar. There are
                  three buses a day from Shkodër to Ulcinj in Montenegro via the
                  Muriqan border crossing, at the time of writing these were at
                  09:00, 14:15 & 16:00, fare around €6, journey time around an
                  hour. There are then regular buses from Ulcinj to Bar every
                  hour or two, journey time half an hour, fare around €2.50.
                  Alternatively, a taxi from Shkodër to the border at Muriqan
                  and on to Ulcinj should cost about €15-€20. Map of

                Two daily trains link Bar & Podgorica with Belgrade Topcider
                station, one a daytime train, the other an overnight sleeper
                with sleeping-cars and seats, see the Belgrade to Montenegro
                page for times, fares, photos & info. The sleeper train will
                save you time as you can leave in the evening of day 2 and
                arrive in Belgrade on the morning of day 3. But staying
                overnight and taking the day train is good because of the
                fantastic scenery along this route (you'd then arrive in the
                evening of day 3). You can check train times at the Serbian

              Travelling by train in Albania is an experience not to be missed.
              Second hand coaches from Italy, Austria or Germany hauled by
              Czech-built diesels clickety-clack across the countryside at about
              35 mph (or less!). Don't be surprised by torn seats or broken
              windows, but then, what do you expect for 50p? You may be able to
              check these train times at www.hsh.com.al, but please also
              double-check locally. All trains are one class only.

              <strong>Update 2024:</strong> In December 2023 there appeared to
              be no trains running at all. The Durres-Kashar line is closed for
              rebuilding, it partly reopened in late 2023, but seems to have
              closed again. A Fri/Sat/Sun Durres-Elbasan train is running, but
              using a station called Plazh near Durres, not Durres station.
              Check the current situation.

              Kashar station is 7.6 km from central Tiranë, local city buses
              available.

            <p>
              In 2015 a new service started between Durres & Kashar, 7.6 km from
              Tiranë. The old station in Tiranë was closed in September 2013 and
              since then there have been no trains at all between Durrës &
              Tiranë. But from 26 May 2015 a service resumed between Durres and
              a station on the outskirts of Tiranë called Kashar, details shown
              here. In the longer term a new Tiranë station is allegedly being
              built, allegedly near the Hygeia Hospital,

                There were previously 7 or more daily trains in each direction
                between Durres and Tiranë, the service shown here follows the
                fuel shortages and reduction in service. On a good day you can

              <h2>Fares and how to buy tickets...</h2>
              <p>
                Fares are incredibly cheap. Durrës to Kashar one-way costs 70
                Lek, or about 50p, with the city bus between Kashar and central
                Tiranë costing an extra 30 Lek. Durrës to Shkodër is 160 Lek,
                about £1. Tickets are not sold in advance, only for the next
                train.

              There are no international trains to or from Albania, but here's
              how to travel to or from neighbouring countries by bus, taxi or
              ferry...
            </p>
            <h2>
              Travelling from Tiranë to Bar (Montenegro), Podgorica (Montenegro)
              & Belgrade (Serbia)
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Day 1, take the afternoon train from Tiranë to Shkodër and
                  stay overnight.
                  <a href="#inland">See the train times above.</a> Take a bus if
                  the train isn't running.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  On day 2, you have two options: Travel by taxi via the Han i
                  Hot border to Podgorica in Montenegro, or travel by bus to
                  Ulcinj then another bus to Bar in Montenegro.
                </p>
                <p class="second">
                  If you choose the taxi option, the total journey from Shkodër
                  to Podgorica is 59.7 km, and should take about 90 minutes
                  including the need to change taxis at the border. Each of the
                  two taxis should cost in the region of €20.
                </p>
                <p class="second">
                  If you choose the bus option, there are three buses a day from
                  Shkodër to Ulcinj in Montenegro via the Muriqan border
                  crossing, at the time of writing these were 09:00, 14:15 &
                  16:00 (in the other direction, buses leave Ulcinj for Shkodër
                  at 06:00, 12:30 & 16:30). There are then reasonably frequent
                  buses from Ulcinj to Bar.
                </p>
                <p class="second">
                  Alternatively, a taxi from Shkodër to the border at Muriqan
                  should cost about €10-€15, and a taxi from Muriqan to Ulcinj
                  around €20-€25.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Two daily trains link Bar & Podgorica with Belgrade, one a
                  daytime train, the other an overnight sleeper with
                  sleeping-cars and seats. The sleeper train will save you time
                  as you can leave in the evening of day 2 and arrive in
                  Belgrade on the morning of day 3. But staying the evening of
                  day 3).

              <li>
                <p>
                  International trains link Belgrade with Budapest, Vienna,
                  Zagreb, Bucharest and many other European destinations, see
                  the international trains from Belgrade page or use the journey

                  In the other direction for travel <em>to</em> Albania, simply

          <p>
            I am a passionate and dedicated pharmacist with years of experience
            in the healthcare industry. My journey in pharmacy has equipped me
            with a deep understanding of medications, patient care, and the
            complexities of the healthcare system. I am committed to improving
            patient outcomes and ensuring that everyone has access to the best
            pharmaceutical care.

          <h3>Exploring Frontend Development</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, I've embarked on an exciting new adventure in the world of
            frontend development. As a beginner, I am diving into the
            intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly amazed
            by the endless possibilities that web development offers. This blog
            is not only a space to share my progress and projects but also a
            place to connect with fellow learners and experienced developers who
            can inspire and guide me on this journey.
          </p>
          <h3>Chess Enthusiast</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to my professional and technical pursuits, I am an avid
            chess player. Chess is more than just a game for me; it's a mental
            challenge that sharpens my strategic thinking and problem-solving
            skills. Whether it's a friendly game with friends or a competitive
            match, I love the thrill of the game and the endless opportunities
            for learning and improvement.
          </p>
          <h3>Why This Blog?</h3>
          <p>
            This blog is a reflection of my diverse interests and a platform to
            share my experiences, insights, and knowledge with you. Whether
            you're here to learn more about pharmacy, follow my frontend
            development journey, or engage in discussions about chess, I hope
            you find something valuable and inspiring. Thank you for visiting,
            and I look forward to connecting with you!
