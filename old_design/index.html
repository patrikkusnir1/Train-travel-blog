            Albania, which Albanians call Shqipëria or Land of the Eagles, was
            once the most mysterious country in Europe. It became a Stalinist
            dictatorship in 1946, and was almost completely shut off from the
            rest of the world for decades. However, the Communist regime was
            overturned in 1991 and in spite of well-publicised troubles in 1992
            & 1997, most of Albania is now safe to visit - you can check

            2. Paris to Milan by TGV...
          </p>
          <p>
            SNCF (French Railways) operates three daily 186 mph TGV trains from
            Paris to Milan. Previously operated by Artesia, a consortium of
            Trenitalia & SNCF, they are now operated entirely by SNCF,
            officially via a new Italian subsidiary, Società Viaggiatori Italia.
            On leaving Paris they sprint over the high-speed line at up to 186
            mph (300 km/h) as far as Lyon St Exupéry, but they then slow right
            down to meander through the scenic Alpine foothills on conventional
            lines via Chambéry, crossing into Italy at Modane and heading
            through Turin to Milan. These TGVs have 1st & 2nd class seats and
            are fully air-conditioned, with new interiors designed by Christian
            Lacroix. There are power sockets for laptops and mobiles at every
            seat and there are baby-changing facilities and designated spaces
            for passengers in wheelchairs. There's a cafe-bar serving drinks,
            snacks & light meals, or feel free to bring your own food & wine
            along for the journey. In first class you can order a 3-course meal
            with wine, served at your seat. You can now buy Paris metro tickets
            from the bar car, too. 1st class TGV passengers can use the Grand
            Voyageurs 1st class lounge at Paris Gare de Lyon. Incidentally,
            SNCF's experienced in-house designer still hasn't forgiven Christian
            Lacroix for breaking the unwritten rule and using warm colours in
            2nd class, cooler colours in 1st class, so see what you think!

            The TGV crosses the Alps via Chambéry and Modane, passing through
            the 13.6 km (8.5 mile) long Fréjus Rail Tunnel, also known less
            accurately as the Mont Cénis tunnel. The tunnel transit takes just 7
            minutes, during which the train enters Italy. Opened in 1871, this
            the oldest of the large tunnels through the Alps, and was the
            longest tunnel in the world from 1871 until 1882 when the Gotthard
            tunnel opened on the Zurich-Milan route.

                  <q>
                    The ferry was very good, and we had a smooth crossing. There were a lot of staff available to help with luggage etc, all in crisp, clean, uniforms. The bunk beds were nice and wide, comfortable and clean, we both slept very well. The en suite shower room was good too, with a decent shower and plenty of hot water. Although the sailing was late at night, there was freshly cooked food available, they seemed geared up to cater for the lorry drivers. Good breakfast too. We couldn't change money for Leks on board but they told us where to go once we landed at Durres and we had a perfectly good exchange rate there.

          </div>
          <p>
            You can also travel overland to Albania, by train from London & Paris to Belgrade, then the spectacular railway from Belgrade to Podgorica or Bar in Montenegro, then by bus or taxi to the border and on to Shkodër, for the daily Albanian train to Tiranë.  There may be security concerns in some border areas of Albania, so check the latest Foreign Office travel advice at www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice.  The overland option generally takes a day or two longer than the more straightforward train & ferry option via Italy, but you can stop off and see some remarkable parts of the Balkans on the way, such as Belgrade and Montenegro.  Why not go out by ferry and back overland, or vice versa?  Here's how to travel overland:
          </p>
          <h2>From London to Tirane</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Step 1, travel from London or Paris to Belgrade as shown on the London to Serbia page.  The journey takes 2 days and 1 night, or 2 nights.  Arrange train tickets as shown on that page.  Allow at least 2 or 3 hours in Belgrade for onward connections (or stop overnight) as trains may arrive in Belgrade an hour or two late. <span class="cursive">Note that the Zagreb-Belgrade train is still suspended due to Covid-19, Serbia cut off.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
            Step 2, then take a train from Belgrade to Podgorica or Bar in Montenegro over the fabulous Belgrade-Bar railway.  There is a choice of daytime train or overnight sleeper train on this route.  The daytime train means a long journey but it's a good choice for the fantastic scenery along this remarkable rail line.  However, it requires an overnight in Podgorica or Bar.  The sleeper train is more time-effective and it puts you in Podgorica or Bar in the morning with time to make your way to Shkodër in Albania that day, and you'll still see the best scenery at the southern end of the line.  See the Belgrade to Montenegro page for times, fares, photos & info.  You can check train times at the Serbian Railways website www.srbvoz.rs.  Buy your ticket at the station.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Step 3, you have a choice of going via Bar or Podgorica, as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="cursive">Option 1, get off at Podgorica...</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Buses link Podgorica with Shkoder & Tiranë once or twice a day, try busticket4.me/EN.  You get off in Shkoder and take a train from Shkoder to Tiranë if you like, more fun than staying on the bus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternatively, take a Montenegrin taxi from Podgorica to the Albanian border at Han i Hot for around €20, cross into Albania, then take an Albanian taxi from Han i Hot to Shkodër for around €20 more.  The total distance from Podgorica to Shkodër is 59.7 km, the journey should take about 90 minutes including a change of taxis at the border crossing.  Stay overnight in Shkodër.  Next day, take a train (if running, see below) to Durrës & Tiranë, see the train timetable section below.  Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër area.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="cursive">Option 2, get off at Bar...</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Walk 250m from Bar station to Bar's main bus station.  Buses run from Bar to Ulcinj every hour or two from 08:50 until 22:45, journey time about half an hour, fare around €2.50.  Then there are three buses a day from Ulcinj (Montenegro) to Shkodër via the Muriqan border crossing, departing Ulcinj main bus station at 06:00, 12:30 & 16:30, taking an hour, fare around €6, or you can take a taxi from Ulcinj to Shkoder for around €15-€20.  You can then stay overnight and take the morning train to Tiranë.  Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër area.

              Day 1, take the train from Tiranë & Durrës to Shkodër (if running, see below) and stay overnight.  See the train times below.

                On day 2, you have a choice:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="cursive">Option 1</span> is to travel by taxi to Podgorica in Montenegro as follows:  Travel by taxi via the Han i Hot border to Podgorica in Montenegro, or travel by bus to Ulcinj then another bus to Bar in Montenegro.  If you choose the taxi option, the total journey from Shkodër to Podgorica is 59.7 km, and should take about 90 minutes including the need to change taxis at the border.  Each of the two taxis should cost in the region of €20.  Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër area.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="cursive">Option 2</span> is travel by bus to Ulcinj in Montenegro then onwards by bus to Bar.  There are three buses a day from Shkodër to Ulcinj in Montenegro via the Muriqan border crossing, at the time of writing these were at 09:00, 14:15 & 16:00, fare around €6, journey time around an hour.  There are then regular buses from Ulcinj to Bar every hour or two, journey time half an hour, fare around €2.50.  Alternatively, a taxi from Shkodër to the border at Muriqan and on to Ulcinj should cost about €15-€20.  Map of Podgorica/Bar/Shkodër area.

            </li>
            <li>
                Two daily trains link Bar & Podgorica with Belgrade Topcider station, one a daytime train, the other an overnight sleeper with sleeping-cars and seats, see the Belgrade to Montenegro page for times, fares, photos & info.  The sleeper train will save you time as you can leave in the evening of day 2 and arrive in Belgrade on the morning of day 3.  But staying overnight and taking the day train is good because of the fantastic scenery along this route (you'd then arrive in the evening of day 3).  You can check train times at the Serbian Railways website www.srbvoz.rs, and book the train from Belgrade to Podgorica or Bar at the station.
            </li>
          <li>
           <p> Travel from Belgrade to Paris or London as shown on the London to Serbia page.  The journey takes 2 days and 1 night, or 2 nights.  Arrange train tickets as shown on that page. <span class="cursive"> Note that the Belgrade to Zagreb train is still suspended due to Covid-19, Serbia is cut off.</span>

          <p>
            Travelling by train in Albania is an experience not to be missed.  Second hand coaches from Italy, Austria or Germany hauled by Czech-built diesels clickety-clack across the countryside at about 35 mph (or less!).  Don't be surprised by torn seats or broken windows, but then, what do you expect for 50p?  You may be able to check these train times at www.hsh.com.al, but please also double-check locally.  All trains are one class only.

            Update 2022:  In September 2022 only one train is operating, Durres-Elbasan at weekends as shown below.  The Durres-Kashar line is closed for rebuilding.  Feedback appreciated!
